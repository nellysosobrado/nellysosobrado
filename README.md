# (Nelly) Nylegna Kir Sosobrado 

I am currently studying to become a .NET Developer at KYH Stockholm (Liljeholmen), with graduation planned for June 2026.  
I enjoy working with web development and I want to learn more through real projects.

Outside of programming I am also interested in **3D**, **design** and **game development**. 

ðŸ“Œ I am actively looking for an LIA (internship) between 8 December 2025 and 24 April 2026.
