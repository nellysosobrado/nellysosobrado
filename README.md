# Nelly 

I am currently studying to become a .NET Developer at KYH Stockholm (Liljeholmen), with graduation planned for June 2026.  
I enjoy working with C#, ASP.NET, and web development, and I want to learn more through real projects.

Outside of programming, I am also interested in **3D**, **design**, **game development**, and **anime**.  
I would love to combine creativity with code in future projects.

ðŸ“Œ I am actively looking for an LIA (internship) between 8 December 2025 and 24 April 2026.
